# Matrix

The purpose of this project is to write a program that finds the transpose and the multiplication of a matrix with the inputs that we get from the user.
In the beginning, the program will ask the user to enter the size (rows and columns) for the two Matrices.

The two matrices will have the elements :
- mat: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 (first Matrix) 
- MATA: 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0 (second Matrix)

After entering the size, the program will compute the transpose of the second matrix and prints it on the screen.

The transpose of a matrix is a new matrix that is obtained by changing the rows to columns and columns to the row. In other words, transpose of A[ ][ ] is obtained by changing A[ i ][ j ] to A[ j ][ i ].
After we print the Transpose of the second matrix, the program will multiply with the first matrix. Then, the result is displayed on the screen.

Besides multiplying a matrix with a transposed matrix, the column number of the first Matrix and the column of the transposed matrix should be equal. 

If the multiplication isn't possible, an error message will display to the user.
